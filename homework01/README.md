# Learning Python, the start of everything.
#### What are these files about?
This is an explanation concerning homework 1. It will explain what each file does. These are simple python programming examples. It is a good to way to get used to the syntax and other things.

python_exercise1: I created a list of intergers (10 different intergers) and created a function that determined if the element in the list was a odd or even.

python_exercise2: I created a function that had a paramater, and inside that function; it determeind if the number is prime or not. If the number was infact prime it would return that the number is prime. In another function, the purpose was to print out the numbers from 3 to 100 that are only prime.

python_exercise3: I created a function that would receive a list and would square each element and would also cube each element of the inputted list to that function.

#### Here is how to run each program and the possible results:
1. python_exercise1:
    To run the program use the command below:
    ```
    python3 python_exercise1
    ```
    The result of the program will be the following:
    ```
    The number 10 is even
    The number 20 is even
    The number 35 is odd
    The number 43 is odd
    The number 56 is even
    The number 69 is odd
    The number 76 is even
    The number 89 is odd
    The number 99 is odd
    The number 120 is even
    ```
2. python_exercise2:
    To run the program use the command below:
    ```
    python3 python_exercise2
    ```
    The result of the program will be the following:
    ```
    The number 3 is a prime number
    The number 5 is a prime number
    The number 7 is a prime number
    The number 11 is a prime number
    The number 13 is a prime number
    etc...
    ```
3. python_exercise3:
    To run this program use the command below:
    ```
    python3 python_exercise3
    ```
    The result of this program will be the following:
    ```
    1  1  1
    2  4  8
    3  9  27
    4  16  64
    5  25  125
    6  36  216
    7  49  343
    8  64  512
    9  81  729
    10  100  1000
    ```
